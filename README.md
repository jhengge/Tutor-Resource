# Tutor-Resource

## What is this resource? 

As you are probably already aware, some of our students are struggling with our Full-Stack Immersion course, especially with Achievement 3. Our main goal is to make sure that our students complete their program in a timely manner while still submitting high-quality work at the same time.  

We're currently in the process of updating and improving our curriculum. Moreover, we'd like to provide you with additional resources for you to help your students through Achievement 3. For the initial rollout of this resource, we'd like to provide you with some tips and tricks for Exercise 3.4. We'll then collect your feedback to determine how helpful you found these resources and how they can be improved in the future. 

## How do I use this resource?  

Please open the 3.4 resource folder in this repo and browse through the available resources. Some of them are designed to anticipate the trouble spots in the Exercise. If your students are facing similar problems, then please share the various tips and tricks with them. There are also a number of external resources that you can share with your students. 

>Remember that it's also important to flag difficult topics and tasks to your students before they encounter them. Encourage your students to seek out the help of additional resources, as well as their tutor and mentor's guidance. Not all students will know where to go for help and they require your help. 

Reassure your student that it's okay to struggle with these complex topics, as they are quite difficult. They will need to factor in extra time to learn the content and will not become experts overnight. It will take lots of repetition and practice.
