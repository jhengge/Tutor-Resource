# Tutor-Resource

##### What is this resource? 

As you are probably already aware, some of our students are struggling with our Full-Stack Immersion course, especially with Achievement 3. Our main goal is to make sure that our students complete their program in a timely manner while still submitting high-quality work at the same time.  

We're currently in the process of updating and improving our curriculum. Moreover, we'd like to provide you with additional resources for you to help your students through Achievement 3. For the initial rollout of this resource, we'd like to provide you with some initial tips and tricks for Exercise 3.4. We'll then collect your feedback to determine how helpful you found these resources and how they can be improved in the future.
