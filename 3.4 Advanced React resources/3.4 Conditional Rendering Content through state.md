# 3.4 Conditional Rendering Content through state
**Rendering Content through state with help of setSelectedMovie and onLoggedIn**
Important to remember is, that setSelectedMovie and  onLoggedIn are only modifying the state of the MainView Component. Inside this component through the conditionals you have in your render function, you are rendering certain components and others not , depending on your state data. This is one way how a single page application works to "change pages" or “change content”.  As an SPA does not reload the page or route with a classic url in the browser.

 Both the `onMovieClick` and  `onBackClick` functions trigger this setSelectedMovie function with a corresponding parameter: movie or null.
