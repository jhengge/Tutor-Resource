# 3.4 Props

**Main View**
In your MainView component you have added a line  `const { user } = this.props;`

This will not work because the MainView are not given any props from its parent container:

```
class MyFlixApplication extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <MainView />
        );
    }
}

```


Props are an important concept in React to pass data from parent to child components. React Props are just normal function arguments in JavaScript. 
You can pass data objects as props but also functions.
Important to keep in mind: React Props are read-only. You will get an error if you try to change their value. 
Here is an article about it with some examples:
- [React.js for Beginners — Props and State Explained](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-js-for-beginners-props-state-explained/)

Next to props React has a concept called state to save and change data that belong to the component.  Important to keep in mind: When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

Here is a video that explains more about the difference between state and props:
