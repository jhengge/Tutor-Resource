# 3.4 RegisterView help on  how-to

**Rendering Content conditionally through state**
In your MainView you are rendering content conditionally with help of the data saved in your state. To render the RegisterView you can also use this state. 
For example you could add a property `register` to your state with a default value. If it is true you can render the RegisterView. 

Currently you are using setSelectedMovie to modify the state and render the MovieView or the MovieCards. `onMovieClick` and  `onBackClick` functions trigger this setSelectedMovie function with a corresponding parameter: movie or null. You can add something similar to navigate from the LoginView to the RegisterView.

Rendering conditionally with state is one way how a single page application works to "change pages" or “change content”.  As an SPA does not reload the page or route with a classic url in the browser. An other way is to use internal routing with React Router, this will be explained later in the course.
