# 3.4 Login View event.preventDefault() / Page Change

**Login View**
In the course material the event parameter is missing in the handle submit function. Without the `event`  or `e`  parameter `event.preventDefault();` does not work and a page reload is triggered. React is a Single Page Application (SPA), which does not need any page reloading for rendering new content. In fact it is a bad practise to do so because, the state will be resetted tot the initial state in every component.
```
    const handleSubmit = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        console.log(username, password);
        props.onLoggedIn(username);
    };

```

With the above code the username and password are successfully logged to the console
