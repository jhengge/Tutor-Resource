# 3.4 How to solve errors

Solving errors is a daily routine for every developer. Knowing and having some basic steps as part of your own routine is an essential skill in the field.

For every error you can do following:
- read the error message carefully
- look where the error is coming from, what component, what is the line of code referenced in the error message
- if you can't find the solution at this line of code, google the error message to see if other had the same problem and already found a solution.

Please do also write in your next submission message, how the testing of your application went, what errors you encountered and if you managed to solve them and how. Looking forward to read your findings!
