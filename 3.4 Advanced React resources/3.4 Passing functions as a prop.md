# 3.4 Passing functions as a prop
**Passing a function as a prop**
Sometimes you need a child component to save data to the state of a parent component. For this can use functions as a prop.

For this to work you need to define a function in the parent and the pass it with a prop into the child component like so:

`<LoginView onLoggedIn={user => this.onLoggedIn(user)} />;`

What actually happens here is that you created a prop called `onLoggedIn` and this prop is a function: `onLoggedIn = (param) => Do Something` 
Every time the onLoggedIn-prop function gets called the the function body is executed. In this case the “Do Something” is also a function: `this.onLoggedIn(user)`. 

This function (`this.onLoggedIn(user)`) is part of the parent component and changes the state there.
