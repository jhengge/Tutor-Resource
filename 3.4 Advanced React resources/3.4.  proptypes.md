# 3.4.  proptypes


**Adding PropTypes**
Unfortunate the requirement for this task to implement PropTypes for all components that use props. I know, defining PropTypes are really a lot of work. But trust me on this, it is a very important practise. If you have an application running live somewhere, PropType warnings save you a ton of unnoticed errors as a developer. Also it will help understanding how the props work really well. 

You can do this ðŸ’ª!
